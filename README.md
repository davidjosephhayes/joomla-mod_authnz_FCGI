# Authenticate 3rd Party Applications with Joomla

This is just an uncomplete experiment. I am confident it will work, but finishing it is beyond the free time I have currently.

Currently you can spin up a daemon, it listens on port 6901, and logs the data pass to a file. It needs to handle the FCGI formatted I/O. There is a library mentioned in the comments that will better handle this.
